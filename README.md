Transportation problem:  It is a special type of Linear Programming Problem in which goods are transported from one set of sources to another set of destinations based on the supply and demand of the origins and destination, respectively, such that the total cost of transportation is minimized.

There are two types of transportation problems:
  Balanced transportation problems, Both supply and demand are equal.
  Unbalanced transportation problem, Supply and demand are not equal. In this case, either a dummy column or row is added based on the necessity to make it a balanced problem.

Below are the methods to find the initial basic feasible solution for a transportation problem:
1. North West Corner Method
2. Row Minimum Method
3. Column Minimum Method
4. Least Cost Method
5. Vogelâ€™s Approximation Method
